					The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same  as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the mesage is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relatioship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amout of data.
				</p>
				<p class="alert"> This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does.</p>

				<p>
					Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often respnsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.
				</p>
				<h2>Questions</h2>
				<p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML.</p>
				<h3>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</h3>
				<p>
					Alt attribute is a text of the image and it is understandable by Google and other search engines. And, it showed to people who have blocked images and  it is read to blind people.
					Title attribute is the text of images which is user sees after hovering over. This is important attribute but not as ALT attribute.


				</p>
				<h3>Please provide an example of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary below</h3>
				<p>
					HTML is stand for hyper text markup languge, it allows to create paragraphs, headings, links, blockquotes and many more for webpages and applications .. For example, we can create a paragraph by placing the enclosed text within a starting &lt;p&gt; and closing &lt;/p&gt; tag
					<h4>Example of mark up defination</h4>
